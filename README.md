## Trader

This is an example application of a trading platform

## Running

`npm install`

This will install all dependencies.

To build the project, first run this command:

`npm start`

This will perform an initial build and start a watcher process that will
update bundle.js with any changes you wish to make.  This watcher is
based on [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and
[Watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify), and it transforms
React's JSX syntax into standard JavaScript with
[Reactify](https://github.com/andreypopp/reactify).

After starting the watcher, you can open `index.html` in your browser to
open the app.
